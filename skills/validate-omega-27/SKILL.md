# Omega-27 Industrial Certification Skill

The "Omega Grade" is the highest standard for AI-driven software development. It guarantees that the system is both a masterpiece of engineering and a fortress of reliability.

## The Omega Equation
**Omega Score = (Alpha Static * 0.6) + (Sigma Runtime * 0.4)**
