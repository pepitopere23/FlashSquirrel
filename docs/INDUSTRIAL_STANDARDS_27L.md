# Industrial-27: Engineering Standards for AI Automation

Comprehensive validation protocol ensuring architectural integrity and runtime stability for autonomous research systems.

---

## Phase A: Alpha Scale (Static Quality Audit)
**Origin: BlueMouse Core Standard**
*   **Target**: Structural integrity and semantic safety.
*   **L1-L4**: Code architecture and AST compliance.
*   **L16 [Security]**: Advanced path sanitization and dangerous function detection.

---

## Phase B: Beta Scale (Sigma Runtime Validation)
**Project: FlashSquirrel Dynamics**
*   **Target**: Runtime resilience and environmental stability.
*   **L18-L20**: Distributed environment lock (VENV, iCloud, API).
*   **L23 [Robustness]**: Chaos testing for multiline/anomalous inputs.

---

## Phase C: Omega-27 (Holistic Certification)
**Result: Industrial Grade Deployment**
*   **Integration**: Merging Phase A (Static) and Phase B (Dynamic) into a singular quality metric.
*   **Scoring**: Weighted average (Static 60% / Dynamic 40%) for Omega certification.
Systems meeting both Alpha and Sigma requirements are certified for production deployment.
